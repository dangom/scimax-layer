* Description
This layer brings some of the functionality provided by the starter package "[[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][scimax]]" into Spacemacs. 
Functions where taken from that distribution as-is, and thus the correct copyright assignment should be given to the author of scimax, not the author of the layer.

** Features:
Scimax offers an extensive Org-Mode opinionated configuration, including (but not limited to):
  - Jupyter-like features for Ipython within org babel
  - Templates for paper writing
  - Persistent text highlighting
  - Functions for better sentence and paragraph navigation

This layer attempts to bring some of that to Spacemacs. The features provided are still far from everything Scimax offers.
* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =scimax= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
